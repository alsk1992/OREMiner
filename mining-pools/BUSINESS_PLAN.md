# ORE Mining Pools - Business Plan

## Executive Summary

**Problem:** Solo ORE miners with small capital lose money due to fixed protocol fees eating their winnings.

**Solution:** Trustless pooled mining where multiple miners contribute capital, mine at scale, and share rewards proportionally.

**Market:** ORE miners seeking profitable mining without massive solo capital requirements.

**Revenue:** 2% management fee on winnings.

## The Problem (Validated)

From actual testing:
- Solo mining at 0.27 SOL/round: **Cost per ORE = $1,826** (market price $463)
- Fixed fees of ~$2/round kill small miners
- Need 50+ SOL to be profitable solo
- Most miners don't have this capital

## The Solution

**Two pools with different strategies:**

### Pool A: "The Banker" (25 Squares)
- **Strategy:** Cover all 25 squares (100% win rate)
- **Target Users:** Conservative, want guaranteed ORE accumulation
- **Expected Returns:** 2-5% per round
- **USP:** Never lose, maximize ORE for 150% APR staking

### Pool B: "The Grinder" (18 Squares)
- **Strategy:** 18 least crowded squares (72% win rate)
- **Target Users:** Moderate risk tolerance, want better ROI
- **Expected Returns:** 8-12% per round
- **USP:** 4x better returns than Pool A with acceptable variance

## Market Opportunity

**Total Addressable Market:**
- ORE has ~500-1000 active miners
- Estimated 60% are small miners (<5 SOL)
- TAM: 300-600 potential pool participants

**Initial Target:**
- 20-50 early adopters
- Pool target size: 50-100 SOL combined
- 6-month goal: 100+ participants, 500+ SOL TVL

## Revenue Model

**Management Fee:** 2% of winnings

**Projected Revenue (Conservative):**

Year 1:
- Average pool size: 100 SOL total
- Average bet: 3 SOL/round
- Rounds per day: 480 (one every 3 min)
- Win rate: 86% (weighted avg of both pools)
- Wins per day: 413 rounds
- Avg profit per win: 0.15 SOL
- Daily winnings: 62 SOL
- **Daily revenue (2% fee): 1.24 SOL = $196**
- **Monthly: $5,880**
- **Yearly: $70,560**

Year 2 (with growth):
- Pool size: 500 SOL
- **Yearly revenue: $352,800**

## Success Scenario

If pools reach 500 SOL TVL with 2% fees:
- Generates $30k/month passive income
- Helps 100+ miners achieve profitable ORE mining
